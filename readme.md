A simple GUI based calculator written in fortran using gtk-fortran for the GUI elements. (Uses Free-form fortran)

This was both my first fortran and gtk project so while the code and end result could use improvements this was an excellent small project for me to learn with.

This 'calculator' can only perform operations on single digits. I may return to it later and add more but this was primarily as a personal introduction to fortran, which it has accomplished. If I return it will be to make use of a fortran preprocessor. In particular I think the use of macros / code generation would greatly improve the qaulity of the code in this project and prevent the excessive copy pasting.
